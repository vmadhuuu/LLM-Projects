# News Research Tool ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

The News Research Tool is an AI-driven application designed to process and retrieve information from multiple news article URLs. Leveraging Streamlit, Langchain, FAISS, and OpenAI embeddings, this tool provides real-time question-answering capabilities along with source references. It is built to facilitate efficient information retrieval and analysis for research purposes.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Load news articles from URLs using `UnstructuredURLLoader`.
- **Text Segmentation**: Split text into manageable chunks with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
- **Embeddings Creation**: Generate vector embeddings using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Store and retrieve data using a FAISS index.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for querying and displaying results.
